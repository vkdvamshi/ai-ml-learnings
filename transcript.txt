OK. Thank you. Now coming to the integration runs, we pushed back saying that we needed more details from an audit standpoint of view that to have those with the Jira ticket process to have all the integration run request to be provided for approvals. So obviously we push back saying that we don't have enough details and then there are no teams availability from.
Krishna Gavvagi 24 minutes 29 seconds
WC if at all of the errors occur or any kind of tech support needed and that's the reason we are not going to have these runs on 29 or 30 or 31 or first of those four days. Raj to let you know. So the only integrations that we will be picking up is going to be on 2nd.
Krishna Gavvagi 24 minutes 49 seconds
That will be for 342 and 3:43. I'm still reviewing the approvals now, so hopefully we will get these things done by this week and support this integrations. These two integrations have like 30 plus files to be processed.
Krishna Gavvagi 25 minutes 6 seconds
