    "Streamlit is a Python library used to create interactive web applications for data science and machine learning. It is often used to build AI-powered meeting notes summarizers. These summarizers allow for the quick deployment of interfaces that can upload audio or text files, interact with large language models, and display structured summaries. \n",
    "Here is an overview of how to build or find Streamlit-based meeting summarizers:\n",
    "Key Features of Streamlit Meeting Summarizers\n",
    "\n",
    "File Uploading: Supports uploading audio (.mp3, .wav) or text (.txt, .pdf, .docx) files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transcription: Integrates with APIs like AssemblyAI or OpenAI Whisper to convert audio to text.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Summarization: Uses LangChain with models like GPT-4 or Gemini-1.5-flash to generate summaries, action items, and key takeaways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download Options: Allows users to export summaries as PDF, Word documents, or Markdown. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Streamlit Apps\n",
    "Meeting Notes Summarizer & Sharer (Groq): A tool that accepts text transcripts and generates bullet points for executives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meeting Minutes Extractor: Uses OpenAIs API to turn transcripts into structured markdown notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Meeting Summarizer (Assembly AI): Allows users to upload audio files, which are then transcribed and divided into chapters with summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Live Meeting Summarizer: Provides speaker diarization and summarizes the conversation. \n",
    "Example Implementation (Backend Structure)\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical Streamlit app for this purpose often involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "UI Setup: import streamlit as st\n",
    "\n",
    "File Loading: st.file_uploader()\n",
    "\n",
    "Backend Integration: Using LangChain for prompt engineering and LLM interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Display: st.markdown() or st.text_area() to show results. \n",
    "Common Tech Stack\n",
    "Frontend/App Framework: Streamlit\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM API: OpenAI (GPT-4o), Google Gemini, or Groq\n",
    "\n",
    "Orchestration: LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "Speech-to-Text: Whisper or AssemblyAI \n",
    "These apps can be easily deployed on the Streamlit Community Cloud. "
